## 1. Excerpt

Allows to install, upgrade, configure and automatically maintain main softwares
used by developers. You can use this script under wsl or virtualbox ubuntu based
images.

Follow these indications to [Install & Configure](#2-install--configuration).
You can see a non exhaustive list of features provided by this tool in this
chapter [Features presentation](#3-features-presentation).

This is a collection of several bash installation scripts using
[bash tools framework](https://fchastanet.github.io/bash-tools-framework/)
allowing to easily install several softwares on ubuntu based image (under wsl or
virtual box or native installation).

## 2. Install & Configuration

### 2.1. Windows (Recommended)

TODO

### 2.2. Virtualbox

TODO

### 2.3. Dev-env install

please follow [Dev-env Installation instructions](docs/Install.md)

## 3. Features presentation

This project will install, update and configure these non exhaustive
dependencies:

- [Awsume](https://awsu.me/) (alternative to Saml2Aws)
- [AwsCli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/?nc1=h_ls)
  - Awscli with default ck configuration
- BashProfile with
  - pre configured aliases
  - default variables PATH, ...
  - completions
  - customized git prompt
  - fasd jump easily to directories/files
  - Kubectx + Kubeps1
- [BashTools](https://github.com/fchastanet/bash-tools) provides some useful
  bash tools:
  - cli -- tool to easily connect to your containers
  - dbImport -- tool to import database from aws or Mizar
  - dbQueryAllDatabases -- tool to execute a query on multiple databases
  - ...

  - very powerful and efficient prompt powerlevel10k
  - oh-my-zsh plugins/themes manager
  - Fzf (search history)
- Fortune (display help message at each bash/zsh login based on the installed
  softwares)
- [Fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - fzf is a general-purpose command-line
  fuzzy finder. It's an interactive Unix filter for command-line that can be
  used with any list; files, command history, processes, hostNames, bookmarks,
  git commits, etc. Fzf configuration comes with
  [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd), fd is a program to find entries in your
  filesystem. It is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find. While
  it does not aim to support all of find's powerful functionality, it provides
  sensible (opinionated) defaults for a majority of use cases.
- Git (default ~/.gitconfig with main branch, email, name, default aliases, ...)
- GitHook
  - configure [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to provide default commit
    linter
  - hook for default commit message prefix based on branch name

### 3.1. Periodical updates

`install` script has been designed to be executed several times over the time.
Anacron dependency configures a periodical execution of this script.

### 3.2. config files backup

`install` script can update or completely rewrite config files that can be
personal like `.bashrc` but don't worry these files are backed up in the
`backup` directory of this project.

## 5. github page

The web page uses [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) to generate a static web
site.

It is recommended to install docsify-cli globally, which helps initializing and
previewing the website locally.

`npm i docsify-cli -g`

Run the local server with docsify serve.

`docsify serve pages`

Navigate to <http://localhost:3000/>

## 6. Acknowledgements

This project is using [bash-tpl](https://github.com/TekWizely/bash-tpl) in order
to compile several bash files into one files.

Like so many projects, this effort has roots in many places.

I would like to thank particularly Bazyli Brz√≥ska for his work on the project
[Bash Infinity](https://github.com/niieani/bash-oo-framework). Framework part of
this project is largely inspired by his work(some parts copied). You can see his
[blog](https://invent.life/project/bash-infinity-framework) too that is really
interesting
